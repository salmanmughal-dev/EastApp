Project Description  

This Software solution was developed using EJS as templating engine and nodejs with MySQL database. The database schema and the data to test the application have been compressed to a file in "Database" folder. It supports PDF generation of reports for students fee, registration and has a dashboard where user can look a summarized overview of the activites.

A Brief Note

Please note that this system was designed and developed back then in 2023 when I was just starting to write Node code so it does not follow best practices. This was mainly for learning about dynamic html code generation from backend and interacting with database from node code.
