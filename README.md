Project Description  

This Software solution was developed using EJS as templating engine and nodejs with MySQL database. The database schema and the data to test the application have been compressed to a file in "Database" folder. It supports PDF generation of reports for students fee, registration and has a dashboard where user can look a summarized overview of the activites.

A Brief Note

Please note that this system was designed and developed back then in 2023 when I was just starting to write NodeJS code so it does not follow best practices nor it effectively reuses the code and the main purpose of its development was to interact with SQL based database and a to render a dynamic user-interface.
